Continuing from exercise 1, in the script.js file, follow the steps below:

Print the length of the array.

Access index 2 and modify the country at that position.

Notes:

Use console.log to print the array length.

Use zero-based indexing (computer counting starts at 0) to access position 2, not human counting (which starts at 1).
